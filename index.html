            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my page! I am a web developer with Javascript, NodeJS, Express, and PostgresSQL! Having gone through an advanced/accelerated course for web development at Dev Mountain in Lehi, I have been able to build out a few projects to illustrate my skills. Check them out below! My hobbies include going to the gym, sports, video games, and reading.</p>

    <p>I started my career working as a laborer at a constuction company, which quickly turned into running the companies tar crew due to my ability to lead coupled with my drive to be learn and be efficent while working. That's where I learned to put my head down and work even though in might be awful. We had a saying and it was "Embrace the suck." meaning we would focus on the stuff we could control and make it has perfect as possible while acknowledging the stuff we couldn't control and embracing it and working with it.</p>

        <p>My core language is Javascript, and I have experience with HTML and CSS as well. Beyond the skills listed here I also work with other frameworks and languages such as JSON, Jest, Selenium, BcryptJS, RESTful API, and Agile. I will be learning Python SE as my specialization with Dev Mountain. I have had exposure to other languages in some degree, but not enough to have them listed here. </p>
